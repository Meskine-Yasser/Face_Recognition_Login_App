# Student Login Desktop App using Facial Recognition

A desktop GUI application for student to login using Facial Recognition implemented using Tkinter, face_recognition, OpenCV-Python libraries.

This project was completed in 3 days due to the client emergency.

It has a Registration, Login, face recognition and a user info interface.



## Usage/Examples

I used Pycharm 2021.3 as my main IDE with conda enviroment and Python version 3.9.

```face_recognition``` 
didn't install properly from 
```pip``` 
because of the dependency 
```dlib```.
So, I had to install dlib manually from the .whl since it didn't install from  
```python pip install dlib```. 
This is the version I installed, [link](https://github.com/shashankx86/dlib_compiled).

Everything else works properly, just run ```facerecognition1.py```.

In the registration page where you should show your face just press ```Space``` to capture your face.
